## Caesar's cipher
   It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter of the text is replaced by another, which appears in the alphabet below a fixed number of times. For example, with a three-position swap, A would be replaced by D, B would become E, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it to communicate with his generals.
