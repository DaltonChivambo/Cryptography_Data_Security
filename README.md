## Caesar's cipher
   It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter of the text is replaced by another, which appears in the alphabet below a fixed number of times. For example, with a three-position swap, A would be replaced by D, B would become E, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it to communicate with his generals.
   
   
## Vigenere cipher
   The Vigenère cipher does not consist of using several Caesar ciphers in sequence, with different offset values ​​dictated by a "keyword". To encrypt, an alphabet table is used consisting of the alphabet written 26 times on different lines, each one shifted cyclically from the previous one by one position.
